### NOTES: 
============

** SERVICE:  to automate/schedule the re-run of tasks in case they fail or crash. 

** for dynamic port mapping on instance, Adjust security group of Instance so that ALB can send traffic to multiple needed ports (of instance). ie. edit inbound rules on SG. 
	OR can do 'all TCP' instead of HTTP  in type and in souce put the name of the Security Group from ALB.
