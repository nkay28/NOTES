NAT vs ELB:  all the internet bound trafic from the private instances goes to the NAT gateway and the NAT gateway sends it out to the internet, gets 
	the reply back and gives it to the private instances. [traffic towards internet BY the private machines goes via NAT ]
	:The traffic originated from internet for private instances/web servers comes via ELB.
