---------------------------------------------

***TO SUPRESS HTTP HEADER response:    (in the cell) : " logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.CRITICAL) " 
	use logging in python for controlling the level of logs/header outputs in a Notebook cell. 
	**The thing to note is that you must add the logging statement at the top of the particular cell you want to trim the output for. 
	

 




IMPORTANT: %%capture
- IPython has a cell magic, " %%capture ", which captures the stdout/stderr of a cell. With this magic you can discard these streams or 
	store them in a variable. By default, %%capture discards these streams. This is a simple way to suppress unwanted output.
	Also, :- " %%capture cap --no-stderr " 
	#*** Still prints Box API content.
